// ! Datatypes 
//* js variable can hold numbers like 100 and text values like "Navy" 
// * If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string 
const pi =3.14;
let name = "navy";

// ! one statement many variables
let name1 = "navy" , car = "volvo" ,price =$3000;
// or 
let name2 = "navy" ,
 car1 = "volvo" ,
 price1 =$3000;


//  ! undefined
//* In computer programs, variables are often declared without a value. 
// *The value can be something that has to be calculated, or something that will be provided later, like user input.

//* A variable declared without a value will have the value undefined.
let stranger;
//  * it is storing the undefined 

// ! re defining js variable 
var carName = "Volvo";
var carName;
//  * If you re-declare a JavaScript variable declared with var, it will not lose its value.
// * You cannot re-declare a variable declared with let or const 

// ! JavaScript Dollar Sign $ 
// * Since JavaScript treats a dollar sign as a letter, identifiers containing $ are valid variable names 
let $ = "Hello World";
let $$$ = 2;
let $myMoney = 5;
